## Metabolic_thermal_performance_curves
This project is investigating the effect of high temperatures on the metabolism of juvenile red drum. This portion focuses on the aerobic metabolism (i.e. aerobic scope). The code creates commonly used models (linear, quadratic, gaussian, modified gaussian, and weibull) to fit thermal performance curves using a maximum likelihood approach. The code is currently accompanied by simulated data.
